# Synapse-X-Open-Source-UI
Free for everyone who owns Synapse X, which is a Roblox exploit. Fully customization and does not use any other external controls, only the ones included in Visual Studio 2019, besides Scintilla for the executor.

# Make sure to own Synapse X before doing this, otherwise it will not work.

### How to make it work:

- First, download or clone the github and open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2019.
- Set your configuration settings to "Release" and "x86"
- Go to "Manage NuGet Packages" located in the top bar under the header "Project".
- Reinstall Scintilla, by clicking the uninstall button and installing it again.
- Go to your Synapse X folder > bin > sxlib > and add sxlib.dll to your references.
- Done! Happy UI making!
